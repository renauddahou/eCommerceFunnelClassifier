[Academic Project] Identifying Target Lead Behaviour Profiles for Specific Product Categories using Machine Learning Tools

• Merged the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce dataset and its respective Marketing Funnel Dataset, and performed exploratory data analysis through data visualisation and feature engineering. 
• Predicted the target customer’s lead behaviour profile using various Machine Learning Techniques such as Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbours, Multivariate linear regression and Random forest. 
• Implemented these techniques using python’s pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries.
• Determined the best machine learning model for this problem and predicted the lead customer behaviour to an accuracy of 71.2%, with limitations due to the size of the dataset.
